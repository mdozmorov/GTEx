# Files to play with GTEx gene expression data

- `boxplot_(sub)types.Rmd` - boxplot expression of selected genes in tissue (sub)types.

- `correlation.Rmd` - run correlation and enrichment analysis on a selected genes in selected tissue.

- `correlation_all.Rmd` - run correlation and enrichment analysis on a selected genes in EACH tissue. Outputs .xlsx file with full correlation output and KEGG pathways enriched in each tissue (separate worksheets)

- `EDA_GTEx.Rmd` - exploratory data analysis of GTEx data. Summary statistics about tissue (sub)types.

- `get_GTEx.R` - download and normalize gene expression data. Saves RDS in `gtex_normalized.rds` file.
